# Compukters Architecture

## Product boundary

Compukters is an in-game Kotlin programming platform with two production authoring paths. Programs created inside a
computer use the Rust-owned `/home` filesystem and the packaged `/rom/edit` and `/rom/kotlinc` tools. The client IDE
owns bounded multi-file projects with `compukter.toml`, an optional `compukter.lock`, and Kotlin sources beneath `src`;
it can analyze and compile a project locally, attach to a computer, and deploy the resulting executable.

Both paths produce the same canonical Compukter artifact and execute through the same VM session boundary. A project
must declare exactly one supported top-level entry point: `fun main()`, `suspend fun main()`, or either form with one
`Array<String>` parameter, returning `Unit`. The standalone playground uses the same compiler artifact and VM session
contracts without the Minecraft carrier.

## Platform and K2 tooling

Guest Kotlin declarations are authored in `guest-platform` as separately versioned modules. Its build produces the
canonical platform bundle consumed by both compilation and IDE analysis. `platform-bundle` owns the bundle model,
codec, module graph, and default imports; `platform-k2` exposes that metadata to K2 without making the K2
implementation part of the platform format.
Constant `Int` and qualified enum-entry defaults cross this bundle explicitly; compiler lowering materializes an
omitted platform argument without a JVM-style mask dispatcher. Other platform default expressions remain unsupported.

Compiler and analysis workers are pinned, isolated JVM processes. Their payloads are assembled into one bounded
`k2-tooling-workers.zip.xz`: nested runtime JARs and the carrier ZIP use canonical stored entries, then the complete
ZIP is compressed as one checksummed XZ stream. The outer runtime uses XZ for Java's pure-Java streaming decoder with
a fixed memory limit and feeds the decoded ZIP directly into bounded, hash-verified, atomic publication.
An external copy of `tooling.bundle` identifies the expected content-addressed cache directory before the carrier is
opened. A cache hit validates the complete file tree and hashes without decompressing XZ; a corrupt hit is
retained until a replacement has been fully decoded and verified, then replaced with the valid tree.
Kotlin compiler and Analysis API internals stay inside the workers and do not enter the mod runtime classpath.
`worker-client` owns the generic payload publication, process, framing, deadline, and immutable-byte machinery shared
by both worker clients.
The production mod archive embeds Tomlj and its ANTLR runtime under a private relocated Compukters namespace. They do
not enter NeoForge's module layer as separate automatic modules and therefore cannot collide with loader-provided
versions; Checker Qual remains compile-only.

The two execution-producing paths are:

```text
In-computer source
  -> Rust captures source and output preconditions
  -> server-global ServerCompilerService
  -> isolated compiler K2 worker
  -> server-global persistent artifact cache
  -> Rust re-verifies and atomically installs the artifact

Client IDE project
  -> bounded project snapshot + manifest + lock + resolved platform profile
  -> client compilation service and client-local artifact cache
  -> isolated compiler K2 worker
  -> attach and verify against a server target
  -> revision-checked deployment into the Rust filesystem
  -> optional canonical terminal submission to run the executable
```

Both compilation services send ordered project sources, target settings, worker identity, platform-module identities,
and limits through the same bounded compiler protocol. `compiler-k2-engine` owns the shared FIR-to-IR and Compukter
lowering implementation; `compiler-k2` supplies the isolated compiler-worker entry point and payload.

The client IDE has a separate analysis path. `ide-analysis-client` owns the bounded protocol, scheduling,
cancellation, and worker lifetime without depending on K2. `ide-analysis-k2` owns the isolated incremental K2
workspace and answers diagnostics, completion, symbol, reference, expression, and semantic-token queries. Compilation
and analysis use the same resolved platform bundle and source-snapshot identities, but have separate worker sessions
and result contracts.

Analysis protocol v8 also carries explicit Kotlin format and parameter-information requests. Parameter information
resolves the innermost call at a UTF-16 caret into a bounded, deterministically ordered set of K2-substituted callable
signatures with active-parameter spans; client-side snapshot, revision, path, caret, and call-range checks reject stale
popup results. The format request includes the exact editor text and
UTF-16 caret captured by the Reformat Code action, so formatting does not depend on whether the semantic snapshot has
caught up. The worker runs ktlint standard rules from a compiler-free nested runtime whose shaded IntelliJ references
are relocated back to the ordinary namespace. Its child classloader reloads the worker's existing Kotlin compiler JAR
files with a platform parent: the distribution stores one compiler copy, while formatter and Analysis API retain
separate IntelliJ global state. Formatted text is bounded by the negotiated source-file limit; the client applies a
current result as one undoable edit and leaves the document dirty for a separate save. Stale results are discarded,
and formatter failures warn without changing or saving the source. Ctrl+S, autosave, and implicit saves do not format.

## Server compilation

The trusted server JVM owns compiler scheduling, diagnostics, artifact production, and the server-global
content-addressed cache. The Rust machine validates guest paths, captures an immutable source snapshot plus filesystem
preconditions, and suspends only the requesting foreground process. The server tick submits and polls bounded compiler
work without waiting on the worker or cache. On completion Rust re-verifies the complete artifact and atomically
installs it only if the source and output preconditions still match. Native buffers remain caller-owned and no Rust
pointer enters Kotlin.

The packaged tooling payload is validated and published beneath `<world>/compukters/compiler-worker`; temporary
worker state is kept separately beneath `<world>/compukters/compiler-temp`. Successful server artifacts are stored
beneath `<world>/compukters/compiler-cache/v1`, shared by every computer and dimension in that server world, and reused
after restart. Cache keys cover the ordered source snapshot, compiler and payload identity, target, selected trusted
platform modules, and compilation limits. Cache publication and cache hits both pass the stateless Rust artifact
verifier over FFM; runtime admission quotas are deliberately not part of cache validity.

`ServerCompilerService` performs bounded asynchronous preparation, persistent-cache lookup, and single-flight
deduplication by compilation identity. Minecraft-facing code submits requests and drains completions; worker and cache
I/O run outside the server tick thread.

## Runtime ownership

The asynchronous actor migration (#603) has a server-scoped service registered with NeoForge. Server startup records
its lifetime; workers are allocated on first use. Each pre-tick drains at most 1024 actor results and runs reply
callbacks on the server thread before world and block-entity ticking. Work submitted during one tick therefore has the
full inter-tick interval before the next deterministic delivery boundary. Stopping removes the service before closing
it, so late callbacks cannot reopen it.
Production computers attach one actor identified by `ComputerId` and a machine epoch. A full scheduler rejects a new
attachment without blocking or failing the server tick; the block remains powered off and retries on a later tick.
The server config exposes `vm.workers`, `vm.maximum_actors`, `vm.mailbox_capacity`, `vm.messages_per_turn`, and
`vm.result_capacity_per_worker`; defaults are half of the available processors clamped to 2..8, 4096 actors, 64
commands, 4 commands per turn, and 256 replies per worker. Operators may explicitly configure up to 64 workers.
Increasing queue limits trades bounded memory for burst tolerance; increasing messages per turn trades inter-actor
latency for locality.

Scheduler snapshots read atomic counters and bounded lane sizes without scanning registered actors. Every five seconds
the debug log reports registered actors together with configured capacity, runnable actors, mailbox and result depths,
worker occupancy, average/maximum command-queue latency, average/maximum execution time, completed-result latency, the
last server pump size and duration, deferred world requests, host-completion-to-next-advance delay in server ticks,
and rejected or capacity-coalesced redstone input submissions. Pending redstone transitions retain their sampled order
while a VM turn is in flight, up to the configured mailbox capacity; overflow coalesces only the newest retained packet
and increments the diagnostic counter. These are lifetime counters and gauges for the current server service rather
than an equal-CPU or delivery-latency contract.

`ActorProgramComputer` is the asynchronous carrier implementation for that migration. Its server-side state is an
observation from actor replies, and terminal, filesystem, deployment, and input requests return futures. The scheduler
admits at most one pending or executing tick permit per actor, while completed replies may remain queued for the next
server-thread pump without blocking admission of a later tick. The carrier suppresses obsolete lifecycle replies and
performs redstone and sound world actions on its owning server thread. On a later server tick it submits one typed
continuation containing the immutable world-action result. The actor validates and applies that completion before using
the same command to perform the next bounded advance; its single reply both completes the old deferred request and may
publish the next one. A full actor mailbox retains the exact continuation for retry without repeating the world mutation.
Its close future reports the final filesystem generation after accepted work drains and native resources close; this
barrier does not depend on server result pumping and may complete on a worker thread.

`ProgramRuntimeHost` owns one current Rust `ComputerMachine`, advances it with bounded guest and maintenance budgets,
commits terminal changes once per active server tick, and exposes typed full/delta states and failures through JDK 25
FFM on the 26.1 product line. The Java 21 runtime API owns the same typed session boundary independently of its native
transport. It does not own a second grid or output transcript. It is loader-independent and confined to its actor worker.
Within one process, the Rust VM may schedule several bounded cooperative Guest tasks. Exactly one task executes
instructions at once; suspension on a host request or `Task.join()` transfers execution to the next runnable task in
FIFO order. Pending requests retain their `(TaskId, RequestId)` owner, so independent reads and writes may remain in
flight and complete out of order without running Guest code re-entrantly. Returning from the root task ends the process
and cancels its remaining task work.
The production execution profile reserves a 256 KiB managed heap for each active foreground process; child-process
capacity is charged independently while its parent is suspended. Heap arenas are released with their owning machine.
An explicit actor request can also compose one immutable resource snapshot from host lifecycle/configuration and the
native machine's semantic work, Guest heap, admitted mutable execution-resident, and filesystem quota counters. The
host counts Guest and maintenance budgets only when it actually invokes native advancement; both host and native
counters saturate explicitly instead of overflowing. These values describe VM work and granted capacity, not host CPU
percentage. No sampling loop, history buffer, heap-content scan, or unsolicited FFM call runs for unobserved computers.

Published Runtime 0.13.0 platform bundles use manifest schema 2 and contain the FFI and JNI native libraries for one
operating-system target under a single Runtime, VM commit, and C ABI identity. Bundle validation covers both transport
entries before staging; the Java 25 runtime module packages only FFI, while the Java 21 runtime module packages only
JNI. The two Minecraft release artifacts therefore share one pinned native release without carrying an unusable
transport.
Runtime ABI 1.3 adds exact decimal materialization for the existing `I64` scalar form; artifacts require it only when
an `I64` value is converted to `String`, while purely numeric `Long` programs remain compatible with Runtime ABI 1.0.

The Minecraft carrier owns exactly one actor endpoint and submits at most one ordinary advance or host continuation
for each server tick. Rust starts
`/rom/boot`, compiled from `system/programs/boot.kt`; boot delegates to `/rom/shell`, compiled from
`system/programs/shell.kt`. A foreground child suspends its parent until it exits or fails. There is one active
foreground lane today, while the runtime contract leaves room for later parallel execution. Reboot replaces the
complete machine stack and clears the terminal. Minecraft sends full state to a new viewer and ordered deltas
thereafter. Terminal viewers submit bounded asynchronous key, text, state, resync, and resource-snapshot operations,
which merge in server-arrival order without client-side echo or a terminal input lease. A valid standalone-terminal
viewer samples resources immediately and then every ten server ticks through the same single-poll admission. Its
viewer-local window retains one prior sample to derive semantic consumed/granted Guest-unit usage; it is discarded on
close, invalidation, machine replacement, or server stop. Replies are published only after returning to the server
thread and only while the viewer still refers to the same machine epoch.

The raw terminal is a synchronous Rust device: cell writes, positional writes, rectangular fills, colors, cursor
changes, and input polling never cross into Minecraft. The authoritative fixed 51x19 cell grid and its replication
journal live in the machine; Minecraft only renders full states or ordered deltas. Waiting for an absent input event
and foreground process execution are explicit suspension points. Kotlin guests consume ordered raw Text and Key
events; there is no compatibility line buffer or second input protocol. A program must finish its active event before
starting an interactive child, so event ownership never leaks across foreground process frames. The server host never
blocks the Minecraft thread.

Minecraft owns the persistent 30-bit redstone output register and samples dirty local faces before VM advancement.
Rust owns the complete input snapshot, predicate waiters, and confirmed output mirror. Input crosses FFI as one scalar
changed-mask-plus-levels packet; output requests are reduced in publication order and committed through one
loader-independent host port at most once per computer per tick. A successful physical commit is confirmed to Rust
before every original blocking request resumes. Completion and the next bounded advance share one actor command and
one result without allowing multiple advances in a server tick. VM halt, fault, shutdown, reboot, and replacement never
synthesize a zero output.

One-shot sound requests cross the same actor boundary as immutable `(note, volume)` batches. Minecraft emits the
vanilla note-block pling in the block sound category, using equal-temperament pitch around neutral note 12, before the
VM task receives its Boolean admission result. Each loaded computer has a four-tick cooldown, and one server-wide
counter admits at most 64 computer sounds per tick. Rejected sounds return `false` immediately and are never queued;
unloaded block entities retain no sound state or background work.

The client renders the fixed 51x19 grid in a centered compact panel while the world remains visible through a
translucent dim layer. A separate footer presents rolling `CPU` utilization, current Guest heap and virtual-disk
usage, and concise lifecycle activity. Here `CPU` is the virtual computer's consumed/granted semantic Guest-unit
budget, not physical host timing. Users can select the packaged Cozette 6x13, Dina 6x10, or ProggyTiny 6x10 terminal
font without changing terminal coordinates or creating a second grid.
The terminal screen can suspend its observation and open the IDE, whose target terminal view consumes the same
replicated terminal state but does not yet display these standalone-terminal gauges. Returning from the IDE reopens
the standalone observation without reopening the screen and receives a fresh authoritative terminal state.

The Rust VM owns verification, the Tier 0 interpreter, managed memory and collection, quotas, traps and faults,
capability suspension, and host-neutral sessions. Future JIT or AOT tiers must remain behind the same verified artifact
and session contract.

## Filesystem and machine lifetime

The Rust runtime owns the guest filesystem and its persistence. Minecraft stores only a stable 128-bit `ComputerId`;
guest paths and bytes never enter block-entity NBT or a JVM-side mirror. Every computer sees an immutable packaged
`/rom` and a private persistent `/home`. The world store lives under `<world>/compukters/filesystems`, performs bounded
I/O on its own worker, flushes active generations on world saves, and drains, flushes, and closes before server shutdown
completes. A permanent `lock` anchor carries a process-lifetime exclusive OS file lock: a live second server is
rejected, while orderly close or process termination releases ownership without deleting the anchor. Removing a
computer through the player destruction lifecycle closes its machine before creating a
recoverable tombstone; ordinary block-entity removal during chunk unload only closes the current machine and preserves
its filesystem.

The Minecraft filesystem registry accepts asynchronous machine-close barriers. An unloading computer retains its
attachment until the barrier completes and the final generation is flushed; destruction defers its tombstone until
that point. Store shutdown starts every outstanding drain before waiting for the combined barrier. Ordinary release
does not wait for VM completion; the server-stopping hook alone permits a bounded ten-second wait. A failed close
barrier keeps the store unavailable rather than closing storage underneath a possibly live native machine.
Native flush, tombstone, recovery, and store close run on one lazy persistence executor per world, outside the
registry monitor and outside both the server tick and VM actor workers. Each world captures the configured VM actor
capacity when its store opens and admits at most that many computer identities, including pending removal/recovery;
each identity owns at most one queued or running token.
Repeated saves coalesce to the latest requested generation. The identity remains unavailable until final persistence
completes, so a quickly reloaded block retries attachment instead of opening a second machine. Failed background
carrier admission is retried once every 20 block-entity ticks; explicit terminal access may retry immediately.
Persistence failures are logged once, fail outstanding lifecycle futures, and prevent unsafe reattachment or store
close. Initial store opening happens during server startup rather than an ordinary computer tick. Calls sharing a
native world-store handle are serialized by a fair lock across VM actors and persistence work, while ordinary VM
execution stays on actor workers.

The versioned C ABI v13 exposes opaque world-store lifecycle operations, machine creation inside a store, stateless
artifact verification, dedicated bounded compilation request and completion calls, and typed `Unit`, `Boolean`,
`String`, or failure host-request completion. Kotlin can select a world
store, identify a computer, request flush, tombstone, or recovery, and route compiler results, but it cannot perform
arbitrary guest file operations. Guest code reaches Rust-owned state only through declared capabilities. The guest
filesystem facade exposes bounded `stat`, `list`, `readText`, and `writeText`; Rust validates paths, UTF-8, permissions,
quotas, and atomic replacement while `/rom` remains immutable. The shell and editor map stable failures to user-facing
diagnostics. Executable installation remains a Rust-owned filesystem transaction and never accepts a host path.

The IDE target protocol is a separate bounded host interface rather than direct filesystem ownership. After attaching
to a target, the client may inspect supported filesystem metadata and content, upload an artifact for verification,
observe the destination revision, and deploy using a verification ticket plus the expected revision. Heartbeats and
detach bound the target attachment lifetime; revision conflicts require an explicit retry or user confirmation.

Server-side IDE verification, deployment, canonical input, and filesystem operations may suspend until the runtime
answers. The request transport admits at most 256 pending operations per server and four per player, including
suspended work. Verification retains its upload staging reservation while awaiting the runtime, and a candidate
returned after its target lease ends is closed instead of becoming a ticket. The IDE terminal also supports suspended
open, resync, input, and polling operations. Each viewer has at most one pending poll; replies are checked against the
current viewer session and machine before publication. The standalone terminal uses the same bounded asynchronous
transport as the IDE terminal, and its viewer state is discarded when the server stops.

## Guest programs and APIs

Boot, shell, `kotlinc`, `edit`, and `vmbench` are ordinary no-std Kotlin programs packaged as extensionless executables in `/rom`.
Shell owns line editing, authoritative echo, prompts, and direct built-ins. A non-absolute external command resolves
first to `/home/<name>` and, only when that path is absent, falls back to `/rom/<name>`; an absolute command is used as
given.

`Process.run(path)` and `Process.run(path, args)` execute one verified extensionless artifact as a foreground child and
return `ProcessResult.Exited(code)` or `ProcessResult.Failed(reason, diagnostic)`. `Process.exit(code)` terminates the
current process. Guest code does not select an explicit capability mask when starting a child.

`/rom/kotlinc source.kt [-o output]` accepts exactly one source file today; its default output is the source basename
without `.kt`. This single-file in-computer command is distinct from the IDE and compiler protocol, which support
bounded multi-file project snapshots.

`/rom/edit <path>` is a nano-like 51x19 editor backed by one managed 4096-unit `CharArray` gap buffer. Cursor motion and
deletion preserve UTF-16 surrogate pairs, CRLF input is normalized to LF, Tab inserts four spaces, Enter inherits
leading indentation, and the viewport scrolls in both axes. Ctrl+S writes through Rust-owned `FileSystem.writeText`;
Ctrl+X exits directly when clean or opens a Y/N/Escape save prompt when dirty. The buffer, source, and compiled artifact
belong to the computer filesystem, while terminal state belongs only to the current VM lifetime. The playable
in-computer loop is `edit demo.kt` -> `kotlinc demo.kt` -> `demo`; source and artifact survive machine reload and remain
isolated by `ComputerId`.

`/rom/vmbench cpu <rounds>` runs the documented deterministic, allocation-free integer/branch workload through the
ordinary foreground process and VM quota path. `/rom/vmbench redstone <rounds>` normalizes the local top output to zero
and then emits one acknowledged weak-power `15 -> 0` pulse per round; every transition suspends through the ordinary
Guest redstone API until its physical server-thread commit is confirmed. These workloads exist to measure aggregate
in-world runtime cost and do not own a timing capability, privileged execution budget, or benchmark-only host path.
See the
[in-world VM benchmark guide](https://certifiedbadideas.github.io/Compukters/VM-BENCHMARK/) for the controlled scaling procedure.
An operator-only harness can run up to 4096 internal headless artifacts through the same verified session and actor
scheduler, including a phased capacity run that settles actors at terminal input, observes 100 idle ticks, samples
their existing resource counters once, and wakes them with an ordinary Text event. It can also dispatch either ordinary
`/rom/vmbench` workload to at most 1000 loaded physical computers in a bounded area. The harness owns no persistent
computer identity, never loads chunks, and does not provide a guest-visible fleet protocol.

Terminal, standard output and error, redstone, sound, process, filesystem, and compiler declarations live in the
`guest-platform` bundle as separately identifiable modules. Compilation and IDE analysis resolve the same module graph
and consume the same Kotlin API surface. General stream handles, pipes, process redirection, and third-party addon
bundles remain later layers.

## Module ownership

Minecraft-independent Gradle modules are physically grouped under `modules/common`; all shared and version-specific
Minecraft integration is grouped under `modules/minecraft`. These directories express source ownership only: the
existing Gradle project paths and artifact names remain flat and stable.

Ownership rules:

- Every module under `modules/common` must remain independent of `net.minecraft.*`.
- Version modules must consume neutral `modules/minecraft/shared` roots rather than another version module's source tree.
- Compatibility declarations must remain in the Compukters namespace and must not emit classes beneath `net.minecraft.*`.
- Kotlin modules must not implement another interpreter or mutable guest machine model.
- `worker-client`, `ide-core`, `ide-analysis-client`, and `ide-client` must not acquire K2 implementation dependencies.
- K2 compiler internals belong to `compiler-k2-engine` and `compiler-k2`; K2 Analysis API internals belong to
  `ide-analysis-k2`.
- Minecraft protocol, UI, and assets require deliberate feature designs and live next to their owning feature.
- Compiler-internal FIR and IR types must not leak into the platform bundle, artifact, worker protocol, FFM, or native
  runtime contracts.
- `LegacyImplementationRemovalTest` prevents removed product contours and old package identities from returning.
